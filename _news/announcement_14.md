Excited to officially kick off my USDOT-funded project via SEMPACT UTC Center as Co-PI! ðŸš€

In this project, weâ€™ll explore the potential of Video Foundation Models (VFMs) for real-time crowd monitoring using edge-computing smart cameras, while leveraging Digital Twins to enhance decision-making for Mega Events.

What makes this even more thrilling? We're targeting the FIFA World Cup 2026 Grand Final at MetLife Stadiumâ€”combining my passion for âš½ soccer with cutting-edge technology! ðŸ¤©

Looking forward to advancing event management and crowd safety through smart solutions!
