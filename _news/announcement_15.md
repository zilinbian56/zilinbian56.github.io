1Ô∏è‚É£ Project 1 focuses on developing AI-enabled Digital Twins to deliver real-time situational awareness of both user-experienced safety risks and mobility congestion, ultimately enhancing the safety and efficiency of urban travel for everyone, every day.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Project 2 will establish a Traffic Education Hub‚Äîa dynamic web portal designed for students and educators. This platform will enable users to seamlessly integrate machine learning methods into transportation problems, enhancing the teaching experience for educators and the learning experience for students as they apply ML/Deep Learning to real-world challenges.
