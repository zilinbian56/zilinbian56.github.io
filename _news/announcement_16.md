I'm excited to share that our project, "**NanoDT: A High-Fidelity, Cost-Efficient Simulation for Emergency Response**", has been awarded by Nvidia's Academic Grant Program! ðŸŽ‰

As Co-PI on this project, Iâ€™m thrilled to leverage multiple RTX-series GPUs to design innovative, high-fidelity simulations that enhance emergency incident management in urban environments.

This work aims to push the boundaries of simulation technology to deliver real-time, impactful solutions for urban safety and resilience. Looking forward to contributing to something both exciting and meaningful! ðŸš€
