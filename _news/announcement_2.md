I gave a talk titled "Advancing Equity from New Angles: A Multi-Dimensional Approach to Accessibility and Reliability with Citibike NYC Case Study." This [presentation](https://c2smarter.engineering.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/6.-sempact_workshop_slides_Zilin.pptx) explores new ways of evaluating equity in transportation mobility services. 
[Click here for more details](https://c2smarter.engineering.nyu.edu/nyu-x-sempact-towards-equitable-progress-in-transportation/)

> Key takeaway: good accessibility of implemented mobility service does not guarantee high quality service, leading to a new perspective in equity.
