Iâ€™m delighted to announce that our paper, "**Digital Twin-Based Driver Risk-Aware Predictive Mobility Analytics for Real-Time Situational Awareness Through Cooperative Sensing**", has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE T-ITS)! ðŸŽ‰

In this work, we introduce **DT-DIMA**, the first urban mobility management framework built on digital-twin architecture that jointly models both traffic mobility and driver-experienced safety risks in real time. DT-DIMA empowers transportation managers with a deeper understanding of traffic dynamics and risk, supporting proactive resource allocation and smarter incident mitigation.
