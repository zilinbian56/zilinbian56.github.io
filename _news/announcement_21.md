Iâ€™m excited to announce that our paper, "**STRAP: Spatial-Temporal Risk-Attentive Vehicle Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving**", has been accepted by the **IEEE 28th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025)**! ðŸŽ‰

In this work, we introduce **STRAP**, a **spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework** that integrates a **risk potential field** into a spatial-temporal encoder and decoder architecture to better anticipate risky maneuvers by nearby vehicles. To further enhance safety-critical predictions, we design a **risk-scaled loss function** that prioritizes accuracy in high-risk scenarios. This approach enables more interpretable, risk-aware trajectory forecasts, supporting robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.
