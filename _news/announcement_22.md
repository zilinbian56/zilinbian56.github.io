Thrilled to share that our paper **“A comprehensive framework for the assessment of the effects of increased electric truck weights on road infrastructure: A New York City case study”** has been accepted by **Transport Policy**! 🚛⚡

In this work, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the impacts of heavier electric trucks on pavements and bridges under different adoption scenarios, highlighting both the benefits of electrification and the added challenges for infrastructure. Using New York City as a case study, we provide insights to guide policymakers on fees, asset management, and design standards for sustainable freight systems.
