I am an incoming Assistant Professor at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I earned my Ph.D. degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from New York University, working with Professor [Kaan Ozbay](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/kaan-ozbay). I also held a M.S. degree in Civil Engineering from University of Florida, and a B.S. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in China. 

<!-- > My research originated from a very simple question: **Do they (e.g., decision maker, transportation manager/operator/planner, policy maker) feel what we (e.g., driver, pedestrian, VRU, etc) feel in our daily urban system?** -->

<!-- My research focuses on bridging the gap between transportation managers, planners, and policymakers, and the experiences of travelers and vulnerable road users. Through innovative approaches such as **digital twins, spatio-temporal modeling, machine/deep learning, control and optimization theory**, I aim to provide those in management roles with a deeper, comprehensive understanding of real-world traveler experiences. My goal is to develop data-driven models and tools that make transportation systems safer, more efficient, sustainable, and resilient, ultimately enabling better-informed decisions that benefit both travelers and the broader community. -->

My research focuses on application-driven, multidisciplinary research to develop AI-driven algorithms and systems that empower policymakers, managers, and travelers to understand, respond to, and operate resiliently in dynamic urban environments. Research directions include (but are not limited to):
- `AI-enabled Modeling for Mobility Systems`
- `Smart and Cooperative Infrastructure Systems`
- `Perception and Scene Understanding for Urban Sensing`
- `Next-generation Multi-scale Simulation & Digital Twins`

<!-- My research interests include `Human-Centered Urban Management Decision Science`, `Connected and Smart Infrastructure System`, `Advanced and Cooperative Digital Twins Situational Awareness`, `Resilient and Sustainable Mobility&Incident Managemnent`. -->
