I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in C2SMARTER Center at New York University. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from New York University, working with Professor [Kaan Ozbay](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/kaan-ozbay). I also held a M.S. degree in Civil Engineering from University of Florida, and a B.S. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in China. 

> My research originated from a very simple question: **Do they (e.g., decision maker, transportation manager/operator/planner, policy maker) feel what we (e.g., driver, pedestrian, VRU, etc) feel in our daily urban system?**

My research focuses on bridging the gap between transportation managers, planners, and policymakers, and the experiences of travelers and vulnerable road users. Through innovative approaches such as **digital twins, spatio-temporal modeling, machine/deep learning, control and optimization theory**, I aim to provide those in management roles with a deeper, comprehensive understanding of real-world traveler experiences. My goal is to develop data-driven models and tools that make transportation systems safer, more efficient, sustainable, and resilient, ultimately enabling better-informed decisions that benefit both travelers and the broader community.

My research interests include `Transportation Digital Twins System`, `Urban Smart Sensing`, `Transportation Mobility and Incident Management`, `Connected and Automated Vehicles`,  `Transport Policy Regulation and Impact`.
