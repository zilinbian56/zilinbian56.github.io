## Introduction
Organizing large-scale events like sports tournaments, festivals, and concerts poses significant challenges, especially for regions already dealing with high levels of congestion and critical infrastructure needs. These events, drawing massive crowds from across states and around the world, can strain transportation systems, security, and public services. One upcoming example is the FIFA World Cup 2026, where millions of visitors are expected to flood into the New York-New Jersey (NYNJ) region. As these events become larger and more unpredictable, itâ€™s clear that traditional transportation management methods alone will not suffice.

Our research project addresses this challenge by developing advanced, technology-driven solutions for smart transportation planning and management. By collaborating with local authorities and industry leaders, our goal is to pioneer a set of innovative tools that use cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer vision, and Digital Twin (DT) systems. These systems are designed to detect crowds, manage traffic incidents, and respond to emergencies in real-time, ensuring safe and efficient travel experiences for event attendees.

A Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual model that mirrors the physical world in real-time. By integrating this technology with AI-powered computer vision, we can enhance the ability to detect clusters of visitors, monitor traffic flow, and proactively manage disruptions. Using smart cameras equipped with Edge AI computing, the system will enable predictive capabilities that help prevent potential risks, whether it's a traffic jam or an emergency incident.

In collaboration with local stakeholders, this project not only provides immediate solutions for managing events like the FIFA World Cup but also contributes to long-term resilience for transportation systems in high-density urban regions. By leveraging both technology and local insights, our aim is to develop solutions that improve urban mobility for all, particularly vulnerable communities.
